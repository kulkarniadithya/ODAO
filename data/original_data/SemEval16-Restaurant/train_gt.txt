Restaurant B-T 2
Saul I-T 2

, O 0
the O 0
service B-T 2
is O 0
excellent B-OP 1
, O 0
the O 0
decor B-T 2
cool O 0
and O 0
understated O 0
. O 0

I O 0

the O 0
duck B-T 2
breast I-T 2
special I-T 2
on O 0
my O 0
last O 0
visit O 0
and O 0
it O 0
was O 0
incredible B-OP 1
. O 0

Ca O 0
n't O 0
wait O 0
wait O 0
for O 0
my O 0
next O 0
visit O 0
. O 0

I O 0
had O 0
my O 0
eyes O 0
on O 0
this O 0
place O 0
, O 0
promising O 0
myself O 0
I O 0
will O 0
one O 0
day O 0
'give O 0
it O 0
a O 0
try O 0
. O 0
' O 0

And O 0
I O 0
hate O 0
to O 0
say O 0
this O 0
but O 0
I O 0
doubt O 0
I O 0
'll O 0
ever O 0
go O 0
back O 0
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
is O 0
very O 0
average O 0
. O 0
. O 0
.the O 0
Thai B-T 2
fusion I-T 2
stuff I-T 2
is O 0
a O 0
bit O 0
too O 0
sweet O 0
, O 0
every O 0
thing O 0
they O 0
serve O 0
is O 0
too O 0
sweet O 0
here O 0
. O 0

The O 0
only O 0
thing O 0
I O 0
moderately O 0
enjoyed B-OP 1
was O 0
their O 0
Grilled B-T 2
Chicken I-T 2
special I-T 2
with I-T 2
Edamame I-T 2
Puree I-T 2
. O 0

I O 0
had O 0
never O 0
had O 0
Edamame B-T 2
pureed I-T 2
before O 0
but O 0
I O 0
thought O 0
it O 0
was O 0
innovative B-OP 1
and O 0
tasty B-OP 1
( O 0
could O 0
've O 0
used O 0
a O 0
bit O 0
more O 0
salt O 0
) O 0
. O 0

Anyways O 0
, O 0
if O 0
you O 0
're O 0
in O 0
the O 0
neighborhood O 0
to O 0
eat O 0
good O 0
food O 0
, O 0
I O 0
would O 0
n't O 0
waste O 0
my O 0
time O 0
trying O 0
to O 0
find O 0
something O 0
, O 0
rather O 0
go O 0
across O 0
the O 0
street O 0
to O 0
Tamari O 0
. O 0

The O 0
decor B-T 2
is O 0
night O 0
tho O 0
. O 0
. O 0
.but O 0
they O 0
REALLY O 0
need O 0
to O 0
clean O 0
that O 0
vent B-T 2
in O 0
the O 0
ceiling O 0
. O 0
. O 0
.its O 0
quite O 0
un-appetizing O 0
, O 0
and O 0
kills O 0
your O 0
effort O 0
to O 0
make O 0
this O 0
place B-T 2
look O 0
sleek O 0
and O 0
modern O 0
. O 0

We O 0
ate O 0
outside O 0
at O 0
Haru O 0
's O 0
Sake O 0
bar O 0
because O 0
Haru O 0
's O 0
restaurant O 0
next O 0
door O 0
was O 0
overflowing O 0
. O 0

What O 0
's O 0
the O 0
difference O 0
between O 0
the O 0
two O 0
? O 0

Their O 0
sake B-T 2
list I-T 2
was O 0
extensive B-OP 1

were O 0
looking O 0
for O 0
Purple O 0
Haze O 0
, O 0
which O 0
was O 0
n't O 0
listed O 0
but O 0
made O 0
for O 0
us O 0
upon O 0
request O 0
! O 0

The O 0
spicy B-T 2
tuna I-T 2
roll I-T 2
was O 0
unusually O 0
good B-OP 1
and O 0
the O 0
rock B-T 2
shrimp I-T 2
tempura I-T 2
was O 0
awesome O 0
, O 0
great O 0
appetizer O 0
to O 0
share O 0
! O 0

We O 0
went O 0
around O 0
9:30 O 0
on O 0
a O 0
Friday O 0
and O 0
it O 0
had O 0
died O 0
down O 0
a O 0
bit O 0
by O 0
then O 0
so O 0
the O 0
service B-T 2
was O 0
great B-OP 1
! O 0

a O 0
bad B-OP 1
taste I-OP 1
in O 0
my O 0

. O 0

i O 0
happen O 0
to O 0

a O 0
policy O 0
that O 0
goes O 0
along O 0
with O 0
a O 0
little O 0
bit O 0
of O 0
self-respect O 0
, O 0
which O 0
includes O 0
not O 0
letting O 0
a O 0

me O 0
, O 0
i O 0
.e O 0
. O 0
make O 0

bad B-OP 1
asking O 0

or O 0
the O 0

i O 0

the O 0

hmmm O 0
. O 0

This O 0
place B-T 2
has O 0
got O 0
to O 0
be O 0
the O 0
best B-OP 1
japanese O 0
restaurant O 0
in O 0
the O 0
new O 0
york O 0
area O 0
. O 0

I O 0
had O 0
a O 0
great O 0
experience O 0
. O 0

Food B-T 2
is O 0
great B-OP 1
. O 0

Service B-T 2
is O 0
top B-OP 1
notch I-OP 1
. O 0

I O 0
have O 0
been O 0
going O 0
back O 0
again O 0
and O 0
again O 0
. O 0

I O 0
tend O 0
to O 0
judge O 0
a O 0
sushi O 0
restaurant O 0
by O 0
its O 0
sea B-T 2
urchin I-T 2
, O 0
which O 0
was O 0
heavenly B-OP 1
at O 0
sushi O 0
rose O 0
. O 0

It O 0
melted O 0
in O 0
my O 0
little O 0
mouth O 0
and O 0
the O 0
perfect O 0
consistency-not O 0
too O 0
fishy O 0
, O 0
creamy O 0
, O 0
and O 0
slightly O 0
buttery O 0
. O 0

The O 0
sushi B-T 2
seemed O 0
pretty O 0
fresh B-OP 1
and O 0
was O 0
adequately O 0
proportioned B-OP 1
. O 0

The O 0
rice B-T 2
to I-T 2
fish I-T 2
ration I-T 2
was O 0
also O 0
good B-OP 1
-- O 0
they O 0
did O 0
n't O 0
try O 0
to B-T 2
overpack O 0
the O 0
rice B-T 2
. O 0

We O 0
took O 0
advanatage O 0
of O 0
the O 0
half B-T 2
price I-T 2
sushi I-T 2
deal I-T 2
on O 0
saturday O 0
so O 0
it O 0
was O 0
well O 0
worth B-OP 1
it O 0
. O 0

I O 0
went O 0
to O 0
this O 0
restaurant O 0
with O 0
a O 0
woman O 0
that O 0
I O 0
met O 0
recently O 0
. O 0

She O 0
lives O 0
nearby O 0
but O 0
had O 0
never O 0
gone O 0
to O 0
this O 0
establishment O 0
thinking O 0
that O 0
it O 0
might O 0
be O 0
too O 0
touristy O 0
. O 0

Surprisingly O 0
nothing O 0
could O 0
be O 0
further O 0
from O 0
the O 0
truth O 0
. O 0

In O 0
the O 0
evening O 0
, O 0
this O 0
place O 0
attracted B-OP 1
a O 0
well O 0
dressed O 0
, O 0
with O 0
it O 0
, O 0
NY O 0
crowd B-T 2
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
well B-OP 1
prepared I-OP 1
and O 0
the O 0
service B-T 2
impecable O 0
. O 0

I O 0
'm O 0
going O 0
back O 0
. O 0

Having O 0
hunted O 0
around O 0
for O 0
a O 0
quiet O 0
, O 0
romantic O 0
, O 0
yet O 0
not O 0
hideously O 0
expensive O 0
restaurant O 0
I O 0
stumbled O 0
across O 0
reviews O 0
for O 0
La O 0
Lanterna O 0
and O 0
gave O 0
it O 0
a O 0
shot O 0
. O 0

Quite O 0
simply O 0
it O 0
's O 0
like O 0
stepping O 0
out O 0
of O 0
Manhattan O 0
and O 0
into O 0
a O 0
haven O 0
of O 0
tranquility O 0
. O 0

The O 0
service O 0
was O 0
attentive O 0
, O 0
yet O 0
unimposing O 0
, O 0
the O 0
food O 0
was O 0
far O 0
better O 0
than O 0
many O 0
notorious O 0
restaurants O 0
in O 0
Midtown O 0
and O 0
the O 0
wine O 0
list O 0
is O 0
extensive O 0
and O 0
well O 0
priced O 0
. O 0

The O 0
Prix B-T 2
Fixe I-T 2
menu I-T 2
is O 0
worth B-OP 1
every O 0
penny O 0
and O 0
you O 0
get O 0
more O 0
than O 0
enough O 0
( O 0
both O 0
in O 0
quantity O 0
AND O 0
quality O 0
) O 0
. O 0

I O 0
will O 0
be O 0
going O 0
back O 0
and O 0
heartily O 0
recommend O 0
it O 0
! O 0

I O 0
've O 0
had O 0
the O 0
lunch O 0
buffet O 0
at O 0
Chennai O 0
a O 0
couple O 0
of O 0
times O 0
, O 0
when O 0
I O 0
have O 0
been O 0
in O 0
the O 0
neighborhood O 0
. O 0

It O 0
is O 0
terrific O 0
, O 0
as O 0
is O 0
the O 0
value O 0
. O 0

$ O 0
6 O 0
and O 0
there O 0
is O 0
much O 0
tasty B-OP 1
food B-T 2
, O 0
all O 0
of O 0
it O 0
fresh B-OP 1
and O 0
continually O 0
refilled B-OP 1
. O 0

I O 0
am O 0
not O 0
a O 0
vegetarian O 0
but O 0
, O 0
almost O 0
all O 0
the O 0
dishes B-T 2
were O 0
great B-OP 1
. O 0

Frankly O 0
, O 0
when O 0
you O 0
compare O 0
what O 0
you O 0
can O 0
have O 0
here O 0
for O 0
lunch O 0
, O 0
versus O 0
McDs O 0
or O 0
so O 0
many O 0
other O 0
sandwich O 0
shops O 0
in O 0
the O 0
city O 0
, O 0
there O 0
is O 0
no O 0
comparison O 0
. O 0

Go O 0
hungry O 0
and O 0
enjoy O 0
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
here O 0
is O 0
rather O 0
good B-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
only O 0
if O 0
you O 0
like O 0
to O 0
wait O 0
for O 0
it O 0
. O 0

I O 0
like O 0
the O 0
somosas B-T 2
, O 0
chai B-T 2
, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
chole B-T 2
, O 0
but O 0
the O 0
dhosas B-T 2
and O 0
dhal B-T 2
were O 0
kinda O 0
dissapointing O 0

The O 0
service B-T 2
varys B-OP 1
from O 0
day O 0
to O 0
day- O 0
sometimes O 0
they O 0
're O 0
very O 0
nice O 0
, O 0
and O 0
sometimes O 0
not O 0
. O 0

The O 0
kitchen B-T 2
however O 0
, O 0
is O 0
almost O 0
always O 0
slow B-OP 1

, O 0
specify O 0
if O 0
you O 0
like O 0
your O 0

spicy- O 0
its O 0
rather O 0
bland B-OP 1

do O 0
n't O 0
. O 0

The O 0
ambience B-T 2
is O 0
pretty B-OP 1
and O 0
nice B-OP 1
for O 0
conversation O 0
, O 0
so O 0
a O 0

would O 0
probably O 0
be O 0
best O 0

Traditional B-T 2

the O 0

was O 0
rather O 0
noisy O 0
- O 0
the O 0

was O 0
full O 0

probably O 0
5-8 O 0
times O 0

probably O 0
still O 0
the O 0
best B-OP 1
Indian O 0

around O 0

To O 0
sum O 0
it O 0
up O 0
: O 0
Service B-T 2
varies B-OP 1
from O 0
good O 0
to O 0
mediorce O 0
, O 0
depending O 0
on O 0
which O 0
waiter O 0
you O 0
get O 0
; O 0
generally O 0
it O 0
is O 0
just O 0
average O 0
Ok O 0
. O 0

Seating B-T 2
is O 0
always O 0
prompt B-OP 1

in O 0
the O 0
evening O 0

Food B-T 2
is O 0
usually O 0
very O 0
good B-OP 1

your O 0

- O 0
this O 0
is O 0
particularly O 0
true O 0
in O 0
the O 0
evening O 0

is O 0
not O 0
a O 0
problem O 0
during O 0
lunch O 0

. O 0

The O 0
decor B-T 2
is O 0
vibrant B-OP 1

eye-pleasing B-OP 1
with O 0
several O 0
semi-private B-T 2

on O 0
the O 0

have O 0
NEVER B-OP 1
been I-OP 1
disappointed I-OP 1

n't O 0
have O 0
enough O 0
knowledge O 0
of O 0
their O 0

But O 0
they O 0
do O 0
. O 0

( O 0
that O 0
is O 0
A O 0

There O 0
's O 0
nice O 0

small O 0
but O 0
enough O 0
for O 0
6 O 0

Okay-i O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
mind O 0
the O 0
oily O 0
part O 0
( O 0
cause O 0
most O 0

it O 0
was O 0
way O 0
too O 0
bland O 0

The O 0
scallion B-T 2

pretty O 0
tasty B-OP 1

good B-OP 1

hot O 0
muggy O 0
day O 0
. O 0

Kind O 0
of O 0
a O 0
small B-OP 1
place B-T 2
but O 0
I O 0
guess O 0
if O 0
they O 0
are O 0
not O 0
too O 0
busy O 0
might O 0
be O 0
able O 0
to O 0
fit O 0
a O 0
group O 0

Overall O 0
I O 0
would O 0

Coming O 0

It O 0

The O 0
hanger B-T 2

and O 0
the O 0
tuna B-T 2
was O 0
flavorless O 0
not O 0

had O 0
just O 0
been O 0
thawed O 0

Service B-T 2
was O 0
also O 0
horrible B-OP 1

the O 0
ambience B-T 2

not O 0
that O 0
great O 0

DO O 0
not O 0
try O 0
unless O 0
you O 0
're O 0
just O 0
going O 0
there O 0
to O 0
hang O 0
out O 0

the O 0

apparently O 0

no O 0
sense O 0

I O 0
go O 0
and O 0
eat O 0
out O 0
at O 0

is O 0
my O 0
first O 0
time O 0
writing O 0

The O 0

very O 0
hidden O 0

lemon B-T 2

The O 0
menu B-T 2
is O 0
very O 0
limited B-OP 1
- O 0
i O 0
think O 0
we O 0
counted O 0
4 O 0

We O 0
ordered O 0
the O 0
special O 0

was O 0
difficult B-OP 1

The O 0
decor B-T 2
in O 0
this O 0
place O 0
is O 0
very O 0
diner-ish B-OP 1
and O 0
the O 0
kind O 0
of O 0
place O 0
you O 0
expect O 0
in O 0
the O 0
East O 0
Village O 0
- O 0
not O 0
romantic O 0
, O 0
just O 0
simple O 0
, O 0
small O 0

nothing O 0
at O 0

Our O 0
family O 0
never O 0
expected O 0
such O 0
incredible B-OP 1
entertainment O 0
in O 0
a O 0
restaurant B-T 2
. O 0

This O 0
place O 0
must O 0
have O 0
cost O 0
the O 0
owners O 0
afortune O 0
to O 0
build O 0
. O 0

I O 0
think O 0
the O 0
stuff O 0
was O 0
better O 0
than O 0
Disney O 0
. O 0

Our O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
great B-OP 1
too O 0
! O 0

And O 0
really O 0
large B-OP 1
portions B-T 2

The O 0
staff B-T 2
was O 0
the O 0
friendliest B-OP 1

We O 0
will O 0
go O 0
back O 0
every O 0
time O 0
we O 0
are O 0
in O 0
the O 0
City O 0
. O 0

If O 0
you O 0
want O 0
something O 0
really O 0
different B-OP 1
than O 0
try O 0
Jekyll B-T 2
and I-T 2
Hyde I-T 2
. O 0

It O 0
is O 0
a O 0
lot O 0
of O 0

with O 0
live O 0

all O 0

The O 0

horrible B-OP 1
to O 0
us O 0
. O 0

The O 0
hostess B-T 2
and O 0
the O 0
waitress B-T 2
were O 0
incredibly O 0
rude B-OP 1
and O 0
did O 0
everything O 0
they O 0
could O 0
to O 0
rush O 0

We O 0
were O 0

the O 0
waitress B-T 2
basically O 0
through O 0
the O 0
bill O 0
at O 0
us O 0
before O 0
we O 0
had O 0
a O 0
chance O 0
to O 0
order O 0
. O 0

This O 0
place B-T 2
is O 0
pricey B-OP 1
, O 0
and O 0
yes O 0
, O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
is O 0
worth O 0
it O 0

the O 0
service B-T 2
makes O 0
you O 0
feel O 0
like O 0
you O 0

be O 0
paying O 0
a O 0
quater O 0

Went O 0
to O 0
Village O 0
last O 0
night O 0
for O 0
my O 0
birthday O 0
. O 0

We O 0
picked O 0
it O 0
randomly O 0
, O 0
without O 0
a O 0
recommendation O 0
from O 0
someone O 0
who O 0
has O 0
been O 0
there O 0
, O 0
so O 0
we O 0
were O 0
n't O 0
sure O 0
what O 0
to O 0
expect O 0
. O 0

We O 0
were O 0
very O 0
pleasantly O 0
surprised O 0
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
delicious B-OP 1
( O 0
I O 0
had O 0
a O 0
halibut B-T 2
special I-T 2
, O 0
my O 0
husband O 0
had O 0
steak B-T 2
) O 0
, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
service B-T 2
was O 0
top-notch O 0
. O 0

When O 0
my O 0
dessert O 0
came O 0
, O 0
there O 0
was O 0
a O 0
candle O 0
in O 0
it O 0
- O 0
not O 0
because O 0
anyone O 0
asked O 0
for O 0
one O 0
- O 0
but O 0
because O 0
the O 0
waiter B-T 2
must O 0
have O 0
seen O 0
me O 0
opening O 0
my O 0
birthday O 0
card O 0
and O 0
gift O 0
, O 0
and O 0
said O 0
he O 0
knew O 0
it O 0
was O 0
a O 0
special O 0
occassion O 0
of O 0
some O 0
sort O 0
. O 0

Truly O 0
the O 0
mark O 0
of O 0
an O 0
attentive B-OP 1
waiter B-T 2
. O 0

I O 0
highly O 0
recommend B-OP 1
the O 0
restaurant B-T 2
based O 0
on O 0
our O 0
experience O 0
last O 0
night O 0
. O 0

We O 0
ate O 0
at O 0
this O 0
Thai O 0
place O 0
following O 0
the O 0
reviews O 0
but O 0
very O 0
unhappy B-OP 1
with O 0
the O 0
foods B-T 2
. O 0

We O 0
thought O 0
that O 0
this O 0
place O 0
is O 0
using O 0
too O 0
much O 0
of O 0
MSG O 0
cooking O 0
in O 0
the O 0
foods B-T 2
. O 0

Why O 0
? O 0

They O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
concern O 0
much O 0
of O 0
customer O 0
's O 0
health O 0
, O 0
just O 0
want O 0
to O 0
make O 0
money O 0
. O 0

please O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
fool O 0
us O 0
. O 0

I O 0
visit O 0
New O 0
Green O 0
Bo O 0
when O 0
I O 0
have O 0
money O 0
or O 0
when O 0
I O 0
am O 0
broke O 0
. O 0

I O 0
recommend B-OP 1
the O 0
jelly B-T 2
fish I-T 2
, O 0
drunken B-T 2
chicken I-T 2
and O 0
the O 0
soupy B-T 2
dumplings I-T 2
, O 0
certainly O 0
the O 0
stir B-T 2
fry I-T 2
blue I-T 2
crab I-T 2
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
is O 0
so O 0
cheap B-OP 1
and O 0
the O 0
waiters B-T 2
are O 0
nice O 0

Authentic O 0

! O 0
! O 0

I O 0
almost O 0
hesititate O 0
to O 0
write O 0
a O 0
review O 0
because O 0
the O 0
atmosphere B-T 2
was O 0
so O 0
great B-OP 1
and O 0
I O 0
would O 0
hate O 0
for O 0
it O 0
too O 0
become O 0
to O 0
crowded O 0
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
very O 0
good B-OP 1
, O 0
a O 0
great O 0
deal O 0
, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
place B-T 2
its O 0
self O 0
was O 0
great O 0
. O 0

The O 0
wait B-T 2
staff I-T 2
is O 0
very O 0
freindly B-OP 1
, O 0
they O 0
make O 0
it O 0
feel O 0
like O 0
you O 0
're O 0
eating O 0
in O 0
a O 0
freindly B-OP 1
little O 0
european O 0
town O 0
. O 0

I O 0
like O 0
Cafe B-T 2
Noir I-T 2
dont O 0
get O 0
me O 0
wrong O 0
, O 0
it O 0
is O 0
jsut O 0
that O 0
the O 0
people B-T 2
who O 0
work O 0
there O 0
are O 0
evil B-OP 1
and O 0
incompetent B-OP 1
! O 0
! O 0

The O 0
service B-T 2
was O 0
terrible B-OP 1
, O 0
we O 0
had O 0
to O 0
wait O 0
for O 0
everything O 0
and O 0
ask O 0
several O 0
of O 0
different O 0
people O 0
for O 0
the O 0
same O 0
thing O 0
before O 0
we O 0
were O 0
allowed O 0
to O 0
be O 0
served O 0
. O 0

The O 0
waitress B-T 2
, O 0
seems O 0
to O 0
be O 0
more O 0
concerned O 0
of O 0
looking O 0
good O 0
than O 0
actually O 0
waitressing O 0
. O 0

After O 0
dinner O 0
the O 0
manager B-T 2
grabbed O 0
my O 0
boyfriend O 0
, O 0
asked O 0
him O 0
: O 0
Where O 0
are O 0
you O 0
from O 0
. O 0
. O 0
.maybe O 0
you O 0
dont O 0
know O 0
how O 0
things O 0
work O 0
in O 0
America O 0
. O 0
. O 0
.and O 0
in O 0
the O 0
end O 0
stormed O 0
away O 0
almost O 0
teareyed O 0
yelling O 0
that O 0
tips O 0
are O 0
the O 0
only O 0
thing O 0
they O 0
survive O 0
on O 0
. O 0

We O 0
did O 0
tip O 0
, O 0
I O 0
guess O 0
the O 0
model/waitress O 0
just O 0
wanted O 0
more O 0
and O 0
complained O 0
to O 0
the O 0
manager O 0
. O 0

The O 0
whole O 0
set O 0
up O 0
is O 0
truly O 0
unprofessional O 0
and O 0
I O 0
wish O 0
Cafe B-T 2
Noir I-T 2
would O 0
get O 0
some O 0
good B-OP 1
staff B-T 2
, O 0
because O 0
despite O 0
the O 0
current O 0
one O 0
this O 0
is O 0
a O 0
great O 0
place O 0
. O 0

Pizza B-T 2
here O 0
is O 0
consistently O 0
good B-OP 1

Salads B-T 2
are O 0
a O 0
delicious B-OP 1
way O 0
to O 0
begin O 0
the O 0

You O 0
should O 0
pass B-OP 1
on O 0
the O 0
calamari B-T 2
. O 0

It O 0
is O 0
thick O 0
and O 0
slightly O 0

charming B-OP 1
. O 0

Service B-T 2
is O 0
average B-OP 1
. O 0

What O 0
a O 0
great B-OP 1
place B-T 2
. O 0

I O 0
came O 0
into O 0
the O 0
city O 0
to O 0
try O 0
out O 0
this O 0
restaurant O 0
because O 0
a O 0
friend O 0
had O 0
recommended O 0
it O 0
to O 0
my O 0
husband O 0
. O 0

The O 0
ambience B-T 2
was O 0
so O 0
fun B-OP 1
, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
prices O 0
were O 0
great O 0
, O 0
on O 0
top O 0
of O 0
the O 0
fact O 0
that O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
really O 0
tasty O 0
. O 0

I O 0
was O 0
n't O 0
thrilled O 0
to O 0
have O 0
to O 0
wait O 0
on O 0
line O 0
for O 0
thirty O 0
minutes O 0
, O 0
but O 0
I O 0
guess O 0
that O 0
's O 0
the O 0
price O 0
you O 0
pay O 0
for O 0
a O 0
popular O 0
place O 0
. O 0

I O 0
would O 0
definitely O 0
recommend O 0
SEA O 0
if O 0
you O 0
like B-OP 1
thai B-T 2
cuisine I-T 2
! O 0

I O 0
was O 0
here O 0
a O 0
few O 0
weeks O 0
back O 0
and O 0
we O 0
had O 0
the O 0
worst B-OP 1
customer B-T 2
service I-T 2
experience O 0
at O 0
a O 0
restaurant O 0
ever O 0
. O 0

A O 0
gentleman B-T 2
, O 0
maybe O 0
the O 0
manager O 0
, O 0
came O 0
to O 0
our O 0
table O 0
, O 0
and O 0
without O 0
so O 0
much O 0
as O 0
a O 0
smile O 0
or O 0
greeting O 0
asked O 0
for O 0
our O 0
order O 0
. O 0

When O 0
asked O 0
about O 0
how O 0
a O 0
certain O 0
dish O 0
was O 0
prepared O 0
in O 0
comparison O 0
to O 0
a O 0
similar O 0
at O 0
other O 0
thai O 0
restaurants O 0
, O 0
he O 0
replied O 0
this O 0
is O 0
not O 0
Mcdonald O 0
's O 0
, O 0
every O 0
place O 0
makes O 0
things O 0
differently O 0

While O 0
it O 0
is O 0
understandable O 0
that O 0
every O 0
place O 0
is O 0
indeed O 0
different O 0
, O 0
there O 0
was O 0
not O 0
a O 0
need O 0
to O 0
be O 0
uncourteous O 0
to O 0
customers O 0
and O 0
downright O 0
rude O 0
. O 0

The O 0
service O 0
was O 0
poor O 0
, O 0
restaurant O 0
poorly O 0
lit O 0
, O 0
staff O 0
not O 0
very O 0
attentive O 0
and O 0
I O 0
would O 0
have O 0
rather O 0
eaten O 0
at O 0
a O 0
Mcdonald O 0
's O 0
than O 0
this O 0
joint O 0
. O 0

Never O 0

absolutely O 0
Loved B-OP 1

much O 0
about O 0

I O 0
finally O 0
made O 0

dine O 0

I O 0

always O 0

a O 0
great B-OP 1
time I-OP 1
there O 0
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
is O 0
great B-OP 1
and O 0
reasonably B-OP 1
priced I-OP 1
. O 0

I O 0
have O 0
tried O 0
to O 0
make O 0
reservations O 0
, O 0
but O 0
both O 0
times O 0
, O 0
the O 0
hostess B-T 2
did O 0
n't O 0
have O 0

If O 0
the O 0
weather O 0
is O 0
nice O 0
, O 0
try O 0
to O 0
snag O 0
an O 0
outside B-T 2
table I-T 2
. O 0

The O 0
staff B-T 2
has O 0
been O 0
nice B-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
they O 0
seemed O 0
really O 0
stressed B-OP 1
and O 0
the O 0
unisex B-T 2
bathroom I-T 2
needs O 0
to O 0
be O 0
cleaned O 0
more O 0
often O 0
. O 0

My O 0

I O 0

celebrate O 0
my O 0

and O 0
all O 0
I O 0

felt O 0
like O 0

and O 0
enjoyed B-OP 1
every O 0

of O 0
it O 0
. O 0

Considering O 0
we O 0
were O 0
the O 0
last O 0
patrons O 0
there O 0
and O 0
it O 0
was O 0
after O 0
the O 0
closing O 0

the O 0
waitstaff B-T 2
did O 0
not O 0

to O 0
utsav O 0
about O 0
a O 0
yr O 0
ago O 0
with O 0
my O 0
family O 0
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
good B-OP 1
. O 0

The O 0
place B-T 2
was O 0
nice B-OP 1
and O 0
calm B-OP 1
. O 0

but O 0
the O 0
service B-T 2
was O 0
a O 0
bit O 0
slow B-OP 1
. O 0

I O 0
work O 0
around O 0
the O 0
corner O 0
and O 0
tried O 0
it O 0
with O 0
a O 0
colleague O 0
for O 0
the O 0
first O 0
time O 0
. O 0

The O 0
buffet B-T 2
had O 0
a O 0
nice B-OP 1
selection O 0
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
average B-OP 1
or I-OP 1
above I-OP 1
including O 0
some O 0
surprising O 0
tasty O 0
dishes B-T 2
. O 0

Service B-T 2
was O 0
also O 0
very O 0
good B-OP 1
. O 0

I O 0
would O 0
go O 0
back O 0
. O 0

I O 0
got O 0
an O 0
excellent B-OP 1
piece O 0
of O 0
cheesecake B-T 2
and O 0
we O 0
had O 0
several O 0
other O 0
nice O 0
pastries B-T 2
. O 0

I O 0
would O 0
recommend B-OP 1
Roxy O 0
's O 0
for O 0
that O 0
, O 0
but O 0
not O 0
for O 0
their O 0
food B-T 2
. O 0

My O 0
son O 0
and O 0
his O 0
girlfriend O 0
both O 0
wanted O 0
cheeseburgers B-T 2
and O 0
they O 0
were O 0
huge B-OP 1
! O 0

But O 0
, O 0
they O 0
were O 0
too O 0
big O 0
for O 0
the O 0
bun O 0
. O 0

Consequently O 0
, O 0
their O 0
burgers B-T 2
fell B-OP 1
apart I-OP 1
in O 0
their O 0
hands O 0
and O 0
made O 0
such O 0
a O 0
mess O 0
that O 0
they O 0
did'nt O 0
feel O 0
like O 0
finishing O 0
them O 0
. O 0

Also O 0
they O 0
were O 0
$ O 0
15 O 0
each O 0
! O 0

I O 0
had O 0
a B-T 2
huge B-OP 1
pastrami B-T 2
sandwich I-T 2
on I-T 2
a I-T 2
roll I-T 2
. O 0

It O 0
was O 0
$ O 0
14 O 0
not O 0
really O 0
bad O 0
for O 0
a O 0
pound O 0
of O 0
Pastrami-but O 0
it O 0
did O 0
n't O 0
have O 0
much O 0
taste-I O 0
've O 0
had O 0
better O 0
for O 0
less O 0
elsewhere O 0
! O 0

This O 0
place B-T 2
is O 0
really O 0
trendi O 0
but O 0
they O 0
have O 0
forgotten B-OP 1
about O 0
the O 0
most O 0
important O 0
part O 0
of O 0
a O 0
restaurant O 0
, O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
. O 0

The O 0
last O 0
two O 0
times O 0
I O 0
ordered O 0
from O 0
here O 0
my O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
soo O 0
spicy B-OP 1
that O 0
I O 0
could O 0
barely O 0
eat O 0
it O 0
, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
spice B-T 2
took O 0
away O 0
from O 0
the O 0
flavor O 0
of O 0
the O 0
dish O 0
. O 0

And O 0
the O 0
Tom B-T 2
Kha I-T 2
soup I-T 2
was O 0
pathetic B-OP 1
. O 0

If O 0
you O 0
want O 0
good B-OP 1
authentic I-OP 1

this O 0
place O 0
is O 0
not O 0

and O 0
seated O 0
promptly O 0
. O 0

The O 0
menu B-T 2
has O 0
so O 0
many O 0
fish O 0
items O 0

oysters O 0
. O 0

We O 0
all O 0
ordered O 0
different O 0

The O 0

really O 0
, O 0
really O 0
fresh B-OP 1

I O 0
lived O 0

Maine O 0
for O 0
ten O 0
years O 0
and O 0
grew O 0
up O 0
on O 0

We O 0
all O 0
agreed O 0
that O 0

one O 0
of O 0
the O 0
best B-OP 1
seafood O 0
restaurants O 0
in O 0
New O 0

I O 0
stumbled O 0
upon O 0
this O 0
great B-OP 1
pizzeria B-T 2
as O 0
I O 0
explored O 0
my O 0
new O 0
neighborhood O 0

All O 0

the O 0
price O 0
is O 0
even O 0
better O 0
! O 0

I O 0
highly O 0
recommend B-OP 1
the O 0
Sophia B-T 2
pizza I-T 2
. O 0

It O 0
's O 0
to O 0
die O 0
for O 0
! O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
mediocre B-OP 1
at O 0
best O 0
but O 0
it O 0
was O 0
the O 0
horrible O 0
service B-T 2
that O 0
made O 0
me O 0
vow O 0
never O 0
to O 0
go O 0
back O 0
. O 0

Immediately O 0
after O 0
we O 0
paid O 0
, O 0
the O 0
waiter B-T 2
took O 0
the O 0
money O 0
and O 0

more O 0
than O 0
an O 0

As O 0
we O 0
were O 0
leaving O 0
, O 0
the O 0
couple O 0
standing O 0

a O 0

worst O 0
excuse O 0
for O 0
Japanese B-T 2
food I-T 2
I O 0
've O 0
ever O 0
encountered O 0
. O 0

The O 0
soup B-T 2
for I-T 2
the I-T 2

was O 0
soy O 0

. O 0

The O 0
sushi B-T 2
was O 0
awful B-OP 1
! O 0

The O 0
rice B-T 2
was O 0
poor B-OP 1
quality I-OP 1
and O 0
was O 0
cooked B-OP 1
so I-OP 1
badly I-OP 1
it O 0
was O 0
hard B-OP 1
. O 0

Furthermore O 0
, O 0
the O 0
rice B-T 2
had O 0
no O 0
seasoning O 0
, O 0
so O 0
the O 0
sushi B-T 2
was O 0
bland B-OP 1
and O 0
disgusting B-OP 1
. O 0

The O 0
fish B-T 2
was O 0
adequate B-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
inexpertly B-OP 1
sliced I-OP 1

It O 0
is O 0
obvious O 0

any O 0

This O 0

The O 0
only O 0
thing O 0

Terrible B-OP 1

. O 0

Spreads B-T 2
and O 0

- O 0
though O 0
a O 0
bit O 0
pricey B-OP 1
. O 0

Service B-T 2
is O 0
fast B-OP 1
and O 0

Only O 0
drawback O 0
- O 0
they O 0
wo O 0
n't O 0
toast O 0
your O 0
bagel O 0
, O 0
and O 0
they O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
make O 0
eggs O 0
for O 0
the O 0
bagel O 0
. O 0

But O 0
that O 0
is O 0
highly O 0
forgivable O 0
. O 0

Been O 0
there O 0
, O 0
done O 0
that O 0
, O 0
and O 0
New O 0
York O 0
, O 0

's O 0
not O 0
that O 0
big O 0
a O 0
deal O 0
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
is O 0
decent B-OP 1
at O 0
best O 0
, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
ambience B-T 2
, O 0
well O 0
, O 0
it O 0
's O 0
a O 0
matter O 0
of O 0
opinion O 0
, O 0
some O 0
may O 0
consider O 0
it O 0
to O 0
be O 0
a O 0
sweet O 0
thing O 0
, O 0
I O 0
thought O 0
it O 0
was O 0
just O 0
annoying O 0
. O 0

If O 0
celebrities O 0
make O 0
you O 0
sweat O 0
, O 0
then O 0
your O 0
in O 0
for O 0
a O 0
ride O 0
, O 0
but O 0
if O 0
your O 0
like O 0
most O 0
around O 0
these O 0
parts O 0
then O 0
you O 0
'll O 0
just O 0
yawn O 0
and O 0
wonder O 0
whats O 0
with O 0
all O 0
the O 0
hype O 0

the O 0
pricey O 0
side O 0

If O 0
you O 0

is O 0
3 O 0

few O 0
groups O 0

Good O 0
Experience O 0

During O 0
our O 0
trip O 0
to O 0
NYC O 0
, O 0
we O 0
made O 0
reservations O 0
to O 0
dine O 0

. O 0

The O 0
wine B-T 2
list I-T 2
was O 0
extensive B-OP 1
- O 0
though O 0
the O 0
staff B-T 2
did O 0
not O 0
seem O 0
knowledgeable O 0
about O 0
wine B-T 2
pairings O 0
. O 0

The O 0
bread B-T 2
we O 0
received O 0
was O 0
horrible O 0
- O 0
rock O 0
hard O 0
and O 0
cold O 0
- O 0
and O 0
the O 0
`` O 0
free O 0
'' O 0
appetizer B-T 2
of I-T 2
olives I-T 2
was O 0
disappointing O 0
. O 0

However O 0
, O 0
our O 0
main B-T 2
course I-T 2
was O 0
wonderful B-OP 1
. O 0

I O 0
had O 0
fish B-T 2
and O 0
my O 0
husband O 0
had O 0
the O 0
filet B-T 2
- O 0
both O 0
of O 0
which O 0
exceeded B-OP 1
our I-OP 1
expectations I-OP 1
. O 0

The O 0
dessert O 0
( O 0
we O 0
had O 0
a O 0
pear B-T 2
torte I-T 2
) O 0
was O 0
good B-OP 1
- O 0
but O 0
, O 0
once O 0
again O 0
, O 0
the O 0
staff B-T 2
was O 0
unable O 0
to O 0
provide O 0
appropriate O 0
drink O 0
suggestions O 0
. O 0

When O 0
we O 0
inquired O 0
about O 0
ports O 0
- O 0
the O 0
waitress B-T 2
listed O 0
off O 0
several O 0
but O 0
did O 0
not O 0
know O 0
taste O 0
variations O 0
or O 0
cost O 0
. O 0

Not O 0
what O 0
I O 0
would O 0
expect B-OP 1
for O 0
the O 0
price O 0
and O 0
prestige O 0
of O 0
this O 0
location B-T 2
. O 0

All O 0
in O 0
all O 0
, O 0
I O 0
would O 0
return O 0
- O 0
as O 0
it O 0
was O 0
a O 0
beautiful B-OP 1
restaurant B-T 2
- O 0
but O 0
I O 0
hope O 0
the O 0
staff B-T 2
pays O 0
more O 0
attention O 0
to O 0
the O 0
little O 0
details O 0
in O 0
the O 0
future O 0
. O 0

short O 0
and O 0
sweet O 0
 O 0
seating B-T 2
is O 0
great B-OP 1
: O 0
it O 0
's O 0
romantic O 0
, O 0
cozy O 0
and O 0
private O 0
. O 0

The O 0
boths B-T 2
are O 0
not B-OP 1
as I-OP 1
small I-OP 1
as I-OP 1
some O 0
of O 0
the O 0
reviews O 0
make O 0

out O 0
to O 0
look O 0
they O 0
're O 0
perfect B-OP 1
for O 0
2 O 0
people O 0
. O 0

The O 0
service B-T 2
was O 0
extremely O 0
fast B-OP 1
and O 0
attentive B-OP 1

thanks O 0

but O 0
I O 0
barely O 0
understood O 0
1 O 0
word O 0
when O 0
the O 0
waiter B-T 2
took O 0
our O 0
order O 0
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
ok B-OP 1
and O 0
fair B-OP 1
nothing O 0

over O 0
. O 0

Over O 0
all O 0
the O 0
looks B-T 2
of O 0
the O 0
place O 0
exceeds B-OP 1
the O 0
actual O 0
meals B-T 2
. O 0

So O 0
what O 0
you O 0
really O 0
end O 0
up O 0
paying O 0
for O 0
is O 0
the O 0
restaurant B-T 2
not O 0
the O 0

I O 0
've O 0
been O 0
wanting O 0
to O 0
go O 0
to O 0
this O 0
place O 0
forever O 0
and O 0
finally O 0
got O 0
a O 0
table O 0
. O 0

The O 0
menu B-T 2
looked O 0
great B-OP 1
, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
waiter B-T 2
was O 0
very O 0
nice O 0
, O 0
but O 0
when O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
came O 0
, O 0
it O 0
was O 0
average O 0
. O 0

Nevertheless O 0
, O 0
I O 0
finished O 0
my O 0
plate O 0
, O 0
and O 0
that O 0
's O 0
when O 0
I O 0
found O 0
a O 0
maggot O 0
in O 0
mushroom B-T 2
sauce I-T 2
at O 0
the O 0
bottom O 0
. O 0

I O 0
showed O 0
it O 0
to O 0
the O 0
manager B-T 2
, O 0
and O 0
he O 0
smilingly O 0
apologized O 0
and O 0
brought O 0
us O 0
two O 0
free O 0
desserts O 0
( O 0
but O 0
did O 0
not O 0
ask O 0
us O 0
what O 0
we O 0
wanted O 0
and O 0
so O 0
brought O 0
the O 0
last O 0
two O 0
desserts O 0
we O 0
would O 0
have O 0
asked O 0
for O 0
) O 0
. O 0

When O 0
the O 0
bill O 0
came O 0
, O 0
nothing O 0
was O 0
comped O 0
, O 0
so O 0
I O 0
told O 0
the O 0
manager O 0
very O 0
politely O 0
that O 0
we O 0
were O 0
willing O 0
to O 0
pay O 0
for O 0
the O 0
wine O 0
, O 0
but O 0
I O 0
did O 0
n't O 0
think O 0
I O 0
should O 0
have O 0
to O 0
pay O 0
for O 0
food O 0
with O 0
a O 0
maggot O 0
in O 0
it O 0
. O 0

Yes O 0
, O 0
I O 0
ate O 0
the O 0
food O 0
, O 0
but O 0
I O 0
certainly O 0
would O 0
not O 0
have O 0
if O 0
I O 0
had O 0
seen O 0
the O 0
maggot O 0
before O 0
eating O 0
, O 0
and O 0
I O 0
was O 0
at O 0
this O 0
point O 0
fairly O 0
sick O 0
to O 0
my O 0
stomach O 0
. O 0

The O 0
manager B-T 2
finally O 0
said O 0
he O 0
would O 0
comp O 0
the O 0
two O 0
glasses O 0
of O 0
wine O 0
( O 0
which O 0
cost O 0
less O 0
than O 0
the O 0
food O 0
) O 0
, O 0
and O 0
made O 0
it O 0
seem O 0
like O 0
a O 0
big O 0
concession O 0
. O 0

We O 0
paid O 0
and O 0
left O 0
because O 0
we O 0
did O 0
n't O 0
feel O 0
like O 0
arguing O 0
any O 0
more O 0
. O 0

I O 0
have O 0
worked O 0
in O 0
restaurants O 0
and O 0
cook O 0
a O 0
lot O 0
, O 0
and O 0
there O 0
is O 0
no O 0
way O 0
a O 0
maggot O 0
should O 0

I O 0
read O 0
reviews O 0
that O 0
called O 0
the O 0
restaurant B-T 2
too O 0
expensive B-OP 1
and O 0
I O 0
thought O 0
to O 0
myself O 0
, O 0
but O 0
may O 0
be O 0

The B-T 2
Four I-T 2
Seasons I-T 2
has O 0
history O 0
and O 0
it O 0
is O 0
a O 0
sort O 0
of O 0
landmark O 0
of O 0
New O 0
York O 0
City O 0
restaurants O 0
, O 0
but O 0
trust O 0
me O 0
, O 0
they O 0
will O 0
charge O 0
you O 0
through O 0
the O 0
nose O 0
just O 0
so O 0
that O 0
you O 0
can O 0
say O 0
`` O 0
I O 0
've O 0
been O 0
to O 0
the O 0
four O 0
seasons O 0
restaurant O 0
'' O 0
. O 0

I O 0
wanted O 0
to O 0
go O 0
there O 0
to O 0
see O 0
if O 0
it O 0
was O 0
worth O 0
it O 0
and O 0
sadly O 0
, O 0
curiousity O 0
got O 0
the O 0
best O 0
of O 0
me O 0
and O 0
I O 0
paid O 0
dearly O 0
for O 0
it O 0
. O 0

All O 0
in O 0
all O 0
, O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
great B-OP 1
( O 0
except O 0
for O 0
the O 0
dessserts B-T 2
) O 0
. O 0

The O 0
environment B-T 2
is O 0
very O 0
upscale B-OP 1
and O 0
you O 0
will O 0
see O 0
a O 0
lot O 0
of O 0
rich O 0
guys O 0
with O 0
trophy O 0
wives O 0
or O 0
just O 0
highly O 0
paid O 0
escorts O 0
. O 0

If O 0
you O 0
are O 0
going O 0
for O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
, O 0
it O 0
will O 0
not O 0
be O 0
worth B-OP 1
it O 0
. O 0

Yes O 0
, O 0
it O 0
is O 0
good O 0
, O 0
but O 0
I O 0
've O 0
had O 0
better O 0
for O 0
cheaper O 0
. O 0

You O 0
would O 0
think O 0
they O 0
would O 0
make O 0
up O 0
for O 0
it O 0
with O 0
service B-T 2
, O 0
sadly B-OP 1
, O 0
no O 0
. O 0

Service B-T 2
was O 0
just O 0
ok B-OP 1
, O 0
it O 0
is O 0
not O 0
what O 0
you O 0
'd O 0
expect O 0
for O 0
$ O 0
500 O 0
. O 0

Terrible O 0
Waste O 0
of O 0
money O 0
. O 0
. O 0
scammers O 0

I O 0
agree O 0
that O 0
dining O 0
at O 0
Casa B-T 2
La I-T 2
Femme I-T 2
is O 0
like O 0
no O 0
other O 0
dining O 0
experience O 0
! O 0

BUT O 0
not O 0
in O 0
a O 0
good O 0
way O 0
. O 0

I O 0
am O 0
actually O 0
offended O 0
to O 0
have O 0
spent O 0
so O 0
much O 0
money O 0
on O 0
such O 0
a O 0
bad O 0
experience O 0
. O 0

I O 0
literally O 0
just O 0
got O 0
back O 0
home O 0
after O 0
visiting O 0
Casa B-T 2
La I-T 2
Femme I-T 2
and O 0
was O 0
so O 0
offended B-OP 1
by O 0
my O 0
visit O 0
felt O 0
it O 0
necessary O 0
to O 0
try O 0
and O 0
warn O 0
other O 0
diners O 0
who O 0
value O 0
their O 0
money O 0
and O 0
time O 0
. O 0

We O 0
went O 0
to O 0
celebrate O 0
two O 0
birthdays O 0
and O 0
wanted O 0
to O 0
do O 0
something O 0
special O 0
and O 0
different O 0
. O 0

Our O 0
visit O 0
their O 0
to O 0
say O 0
the O 0
least O 0
, O 0
was O 0
an O 0
unpleasant O 0
and O 0
costly O 0
experience O 0
! O 0

And O 0
even O 0
more O 0
so O 0
unpleasant O 0
because O 0
it O 0
was O 0
so O 0
costly O 0
for O 0
such O 0
an O 0
unpleasant O 0
experience O 0
. O 0

We O 0
did O 0
arrive O 0
late O 0
for O 0
our O 0
reservation O 0
so O 0
I O 0
can O 0
not O 0
complain O 0
too O 0
much O 0
about O 0
the O 0
wait B-T 2
for O 0
a O 0
table O 0
. O 0

Although O 0
we O 0
were O 0
told O 0
10-15 O 0
minutes O 0
and O 0
it O 0
was O 0
more O 0
like O 0
45 O 0
minutes O 0
. O 0

We O 0
were O 0
ushered O 0
to O 0
the O 0
bar O 0
to O 0
wait O 0
momentarily O 0
and O 0
upon O 0
arrival O 0
were O 0
so O 0
excited O 0
. O 0

The O 0
place B-T 2
is O 0
beautiful B-OP 1
! O 0

The O 0
hostess B-T 2
was O 0
very O 0
pleasant B-OP 1
. O 0

However O 0
, O 0
our O 0
$ O 0
14 O 0
drinks B-T 2
were O 0
were O 0
horrible B-OP 1
! O 0

Once O 0
we O 0
finally O 0
got O 0
a O 0
table O 0
, O 0
despite O 0
indicating O 0
we O 0
wanted O 0
an O 0
alla O 0
carte O 0
menu O 0
we O 0
were O 0
pushed O 0
into O 0
a O 0
table O 0
that O 0
was O 0
only O 0
price O 0
fixed O 0
! O 0

Since O 0
we O 0
were O 0
already O 0
waiting O 0
so O 0
long O 0
, O 0
we O 0
felt O 0
we O 0
had O 0
no O 0
other O 0
choice O 0
but O 0
to O 0
accept O 0
it O 0
. O 0

Our O 0
experience O 0
did O 0
not O 0
ever O 0
get O 0
any O 0
better O 0
. O 0

For O 0
each O 0
course O 0
we O 0
waited O 0
over O 0
1/2 O 0
hour O 0
to O 0
45 O 0
minutes O 0
and O 0
were O 0
never O 0
offered O 0
a O 0
drink O 0
. O 0

We O 0
also O 0
asked O 0
for O 0
Hooka O 0
six O 0
times O 0
and O 0
the O 0
waiter B-T 2
kept O 0
telling O 0
us O 0
one O 0
minute O 0
and O 0
never O 0
returning O 0
with O 0
the O 0
Hooka O 0
. O 0

After O 0
the O 0
4th O 0
time O 0
i O 0
asked O 0
again O 0
and O 0
the O 0
waiter B-T 2
than O 0
said O 0
after O 0
our O 0
dinner O 0
. O 0

We O 0
asked O 0
for O 0
beverages O 0
and O 0
never O 0
received O 0
them O 0
. O 0

We O 0
asked O 0
for O 0
sides O 0
which O 0
the O 0
waiter B-T 2
than O 0
admitted O 0
that O 0
he O 0
forgot B-OP 1
to O 0
put O 0
in O 0
that O 0
part O 0
of O 0
our O 0
order O 0
. O 0

My O 0
chicken B-T 2
was O 0
inedible B-OP 1
as O 0
there O 0
were O 0
so O 0
many O 0
fatty O 0
lumps O 0
which O 0
i O 0
had O 0
to O 0
keep O 0
spitting O 0
out O 0
into O 0
my O 0
napkin O 0
. O 0

I O 0
would O 0
not O 0
expect O 0
this O 0
for O 0
a O 0
$ O 0
55 O 0
dinner B-T 2
. O 0

By O 0
the O 0
time O 0
we O 0
finished O 0
our O 0
dinner O 0
we O 0
still O 0
had O 0
not O 0
received O 0
one O 0
beverage O 0
NOR O 0
hooka O 0
! O 0

What O 0
we O 0
did O 0
do O 0
was O 0
waste O 0
3 O 0
hours O 0
being O 0
trapped O 0
in O 0
a O 0
table O 0
waiting O 0
and O 0
waiting O 0
for O 0
food O 0
and O 0
drinks O 0
and O 0
hooka O 0
. O 0
. O 0
some O 0
of O 0
which O 0
we O 0
never O 0
received O 0
! O 0

The O 0
only O 0
beverage O 0
we O 0
did O 0
receive O 0
was O 0
water O 0
in O 0
dirty O 0
glasses O 0
! O 0

To O 0
top O 0
it O 0
all O 0
off O 0
. O 0
. O 0
the O 0
main O 0
reason O 0
we O 0
came O 0
to O 0
your O 0
restaurant O 0
was O 0
for O 0
the O 0
belly O 0
dancers O 0
and O 0
missed O 0
the O 0
first O 0
show O 0
as O 0
we O 0
were O 0
not O 0
seated O 0
yet O 0
and O 0
the O 0
2nd O 0
belly O 0
dancer O 0
only O 0
danced O 0
at O 0
two O 0
tables O 0
in O 0
the O 0
back O 0
of O 0
the O 0
restaurant O 0
and O 0
never O 0
made O 0
it O 0
around O 0
to O 0
the O 0
other O 0
half O 0
of O 0
the O 0
restaurant O 0
. O 0

By O 0
the O 0
time O 0
we O 0
left O 0
our O 0
wallets O 0
were O 0
empy O 0
and O 0
so O 0
were O 0
our O 0
stomachs O 0
AND O 0
we O 0
missed O 0
the O 0
show O 0
we O 0
were O 0
supposed O 0
to O 0
see O 0
following O 0
our O 0
dinner O 0
, O 0
which O 0
would O 0
have O 0
been O 0
acceptable O 0
if O 0
we O 0
got O 0
to O 0
enjoy O 0
the O 0
experience O 0
of O 0
good B-OP 1
food B-T 2
and O 0
belly O 0
dancers O 0
! O 0

If O 0
it O 0
seemed O 0
possible O 0
to O 0
do O 0
so O 0
while O 0
there O 0
I O 0
would O 0
have O 0
fought O 0
my O 0
bill O 0
since O 0
my O 0
dinner O 0
portion O 0
of O 0
my O 0
meal B-T 2
was O 0
inedible B-OP 1
! O 0

I O 0
have O 0
never O 0
left O 0
a O 0
restaurant B-T 2
feeling O 0
as O 0
if O 0
i O 0
was O 0
abused B-OP 1
, O 0
and O 0
wasted O 0
my O 0
hard O 0
earned O 0
money O 0
. O 0

MY O 0
husbands O 0
birthday O 0
and O 0
my O 0
sons O 0
was O 0
not O 0
as O 0
it O 0
was O 0
intended O 0
. O 0
. O 0
. O 0
and O 0
we O 0
drove O 0
two O 0
hours O 0
to O 0
spend O 0
too O 0
much O 0
money O 0
to O 0
be O 0
treated O 0
terribly O 0
! O 0

I O 0
wish O 0
I O 0
COULD O 0
be O 0
refunded O 0
! O 0

Do O 0
n't O 0
go O 0
with O 0
a O 0
larger O 0
group O 0
than O 0
4 O 0
! O 0

I O 0
went O 0
here O 0
for O 0
a O 0
family O 0
birthday O 0
dinner O 0
. O 0

Five O 0
of O 0
us O 0
walked O 0
in O 0
at O 0
approximately O 0
6:20 O 0
on O 0
a O 0
Thursday O 0
evening O 0
. O 0

The O 0
hostess O 0
said O 0
`` O 0
Wow O 0
that O 0
's O 0
a O 0
large O 0
group O 0
, O 0
unless O 0
you O 0
are O 0
n't O 0
together O 0
'' O 0
, O 0
to O 0
which O 0
I O 0
replied O 0
`` O 0
no O 0
we O 0
are O 0
, O 0
and O 0
there O 0
will O 0
be O 0
one O 0
more O 0
, O 0
so O 0
a O 0
table O 0
for O 0
six O 0
please O 0
. O 0
'' O 0

At O 0
first O 0
we O 0
were O 0
a O 0
little O 0
taken O 0
aback O 0
, O 0
as O 0
this O 0
seemed O 0
to O 0
present O 0
a O 0
problem O 0
, O 0
although O 0
the O 0
restaurant O 0
looked O 0
fairly O 0
empty O 0
, O 0
but O 0
they O 0
hastily O 0
put O 0
the O 0
table O 0
together O 0
for O 0
us O 0
. O 0

The O 0
menu B-T 2
is O 0
fairly O 0
simple B-OP 1
without O 0
much O 0
descriptions O 0
. O 0

There O 0
was O 0
no O 0
tap O 0
beer B-T 2
that O 0
evening O 0
, O 0
which O 0
was O 0
a O 0
disappointment B-OP 1
. O 0

Not B-OP 1
much I-OP 1
of B-T 2
a O 0
selection B-T 2
of I-T 2
bottled I-T 2
beer I-T 2
either O 0
, O 0
we O 0
went O 0
with O 0
Brahma O 0
. O 0

The O 0
appetizers O 0
we O 0
ordered O 0
were O 0
served O 0
quickly O 0
- O 0
an O 0
order O 0
of O 0
fried B-T 2
oysters I-T 2
and I-T 2
clams I-T 2
were O 0
delicious B-OP 1
but O 0
a O 0
tiny O 0
portion O 0
( O 0
maybe O 0
3 O 0
of O 0
each O 0
) O 0
. O 0

The O 0
lobster B-T 2
knuckles I-T 2
( O 0
special O 0
of O 0
the O 0
day O 0
) O 0
were O 0
ok B-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
pretty O 0
tasteless B-OP 1
. O 0

I O 0
believe O 0
there O 0
were O 0
2 O 0
shrimp B-T 2
in O 0
the O 0
`` B-T 2
salt I-T 2
encrusted I-T 2
shrimp I-T 2
'' I-T 2
appetizer I-T 2
. O 0

After O 0
we O 0
ate O 0
our O 0
appetizers O 0
( O 0
which O 0
took O 0
all O 0
of O 0
8 O 0
minutes O 0
) O 0
we O 0
ordered O 0
another O 0
round O 0
of O 0
Brahma O 0
's O 0
- O 0
and O 0
tried O 0
to O 0
stall O 0
a O 0
little O 0
as O 0
we O 0
waited O 0
for O 0
our O 0
sixth O 0
dinner O 0
member O 0
. O 0

The O 0
waitress O 0
appeared O 0
and O 0
asked O 0
us O 0
if O 0
we O 0
wanted O 0
to O 0
go O 0
ahead O 0
and O 0
order O 0
. O 0

We O 0
replied O 0
that O 0
we O 0
would O 0
like O 0
to O 0
wait O 0
5 O 0
more O 0
minutes O 0
if O 0
that O 0
was O 0
okay O 0
. O 0

She O 0
replied O 0
`` O 0
well O 0
it O 0
would O 0
be O 0
more O 0
convenient O 0
for O 0
us O 0
if O 0
you O 0
ordered O 0
now O 0
, O 0
since O 0
you O 0
are O 0
a O 0
larger O 0
party O 0
, O 0
and O 0
it O 0
might O 0
get O 0
crowded O 0
. O 0
'' O 0

We O 0
called O 0
the O 0
other O 0
person O 0
who O 0
was O 0
very O 0
close O 0
by O 0
, O 0
and O 0
she O 0
told O 0
us O 0
to O 0
order O 0
for O 0
her O 0
, O 0
so O 0
we O 0
did O 0
. O 0

The O 0
food O 0
arrived O 0
in O 0
about O 0
15 O 0
minutes O 0
. O 0

I O 0
had O 0
the O 0
Thai B-T 2
style I-T 2
Fried I-T 2
Sea I-T 2
Bass I-T 2
. O 0
. O 0
.which O 0
was O 0
very O 0
good O 0
. O 0

Everyone O 0
seemed O 0
generally O 0
happy B-OP 1
with O 0
their O 0
food B-T 2
, O 0
except O 0
my O 0
brother O 0
who O 0
had O 0
the O 0
grilled B-T 2
Mahi I-T 2
Mahi I-T 2
, O 0
seemingly O 0
drenched O 0
in O 0
Grapfruit O 0
Juice O 0
! O 0

I O 0
heard O 0
the O 0
lobster B-T 2
roll I-T 2
was O 0
excellent B-OP 1
. O 0

They O 0
seemed O 0
to O 0
continue O 0
to O 0
rush O 0
us O 0
along O 0
, O 0
taking O 0
plates O 0
without O 0
asking O 0
if O 0
we O 0
were O 0
done O 0
( O 0
my O 0
sister O 0
still O 0
had O 0
her O 0
fork O 0
in O 0
hand O 0
) O 0
. O 0

All O 0
in O 0
all O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
good B-OP 1
- O 0
a O 0
little O 0
on O 0
the O 0
expensive B-OP 1
side O 0
, O 0
but O 0
fresh B-OP 1
. O 0

Service B-T 2
not O 0
the O 0
friendliest O 0
to O 0
our O 0
`` O 0
large O 0
party O 0
'' O 0
! O 0

Probably O 0
would O 0
not O 0
go O 0
back O 0
here O 0

I O 0
love O 0
Indian O 0
food O 0
and O 0
eat O 0
it O 0
quite O 0
regularly O 0
, O 0
but O 0
I O 0
can O 0
say O 0
this O 0
is O 0
one O 0
of O 0
the O 0
best O 0
I O 0
've O 0
had O 0

Very O 0
`` O 0

really O 0
well O 0

I O 0
have O 0
it O 0
a O 0

instead O 0
of O 0

because O 0
of O 0
the O 0

chicken B-T 2

, O 0
which O 0
I O 0
would O 0
expect O 0
at O 0
a O 0
upscale O 0
Indian O 0
restaurant O 0
but O 0
this O 0
place B-T 2
does O 0
n't O 0
have O 0
an O 0
upscale O 0
feel B-T 2
. O 0

Also O 0
, O 0
waiters B-T 2
try O 0
to O 0
push O 0
more O 0
food O 0
on O 0
you O 0
, O 0
like O 0
suggest O 0
things O 0
as O 0
if O 0
they O 0
are O 0
complimentary O 0
when O 0
they O 0
actually O 0
cost O 0
$ O 0
. O 0

I O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
appreciate O 0
places O 0
or O 0
people O 0
that O 0
try O 0
to O 0
drive O 0
up O 0
the O 0
bill O 0
without O 0
the O 0
patron O 0
's O 0
knowledge O 0
so O 0
that O 0
was O 0
a O 0
huge O 0
turnoff O 0
( O 0
more O 0
than O 0
the O 0
price O 0
) O 0
. O 0

But O 0
if O 0
you O 0
're O 0
prepared O 0
to O 0
spend O 0
some O 0
$ O 0
and O 0
remember O 0
to O 0
ask O 0
if O 0
something O 0
they O 0
offer O 0
is O 0
complimentary O 0
, O 0
then O 0
this O 0

about O 0

about O 0

I O 0
wont O 0

However O 0
, O 0
once O 0
I O 0
received O 0
my O 0
predictably O 0
mediocre O 0
order O 0
of O 0
what O 0

to O 0

it O 0

your O 0

option O 0

, O 0
I O 0
got O 0
through O 0
about O 0
half O 0
my O 0
kimchee B-T 2
before O 0
I O 0
found O 0
a O 0
piece O 0
of O 0
random O 0
lettuce O 0
accompanied O 0
by O 0
a O 0
far O 0

hence O 0
my O 0
lack O 0
of O 0
previous O 0

, O 0
I O 0
called O 0
the O 0
restaurant O 0
to O 0
give O 0
them O 0
a O 0
heads O 0
up O 0
that O 0

to O 0
check O 0
the O 0
cleanliness O 0
of O 0
their O 0
prep O 0
stations O 0

My O 0
main O 0
concern O 0
was O 0
the O 0
sanity O 0
of O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
that O 0
was O 0
being O 0
sent O 0
out O 0
to O 0
myself O 0
and O 0
others O 0
, O 0
but O 0
I O 0
would O 0
be O 0
lying O 0
is O 0
I O 0
said O 0
that O 0
as O 0
someone O 0
who O 0
has O 0
worked O 0
in O 0
restaurants O 0
since O 0
the O 0
age O 0
of O 0
fifteen O 0
I O 0
was O 0
expecting O 0
at O 0
least O 0
a O 0
minimal O 0
effort O 0
on O 0
the O 0
part O 0
of O 0
the O 0

amend O 0

situation O 0

None O 0

made O 0
so O 0
i O 0
hung O 0
up O 0

Less O 0
than O 0
three O 0
minutes O 0
passed O 0
before O 0
I O 0
found O 0
myself O 0
doubled O 0
over O 0
the O 0
toilet O 0

My O 0
girlfriend O 0
, O 0
being O 0
slightly O 0
more O 0
aggressive O 0
, O 0
and O 0
having O 0
been O 0
equally O 0
disgusted B-OP 1
causing O 0
her O 0
to O 0
throw O 0
out O 0
the O 0
remainder O 0
of O 0
her O 0
barely O 0
eaten O 0
meal B-T 2
, O 0
called O 0
back O 0
only O 0
to O 0
be O 0
informed O 0
that O 0
I O 0
was O 0
probably O 0
wrong O 0
and O 0
that O 0
it O 0
was O 0
most O 0
likely O 0
an O 0
oyster O 0
, O 0
and O 0
that O 0
we O 0
were O 0
also O 0
blacklisted O 0
from O 0
their O 0
restaurant O 0

Not O 0
only O 0

We O 0
know O 0
the O 0
difference O 0
between O 0

It O 0

The O 0
dishes O 0
came O 0
out O 0

The O 0
bibimbap B-T 2
was O 0
average B-OP 1

the O 0
stone B-T 2
bowl I-T 2
was O 0
n't O 0

the O 0

've O 0

decent O 0
Korean O 0

The O 0
side B-T 2

I O 0
did O 0
get O 0
a O 0

The O 0
real O 0

quintessential B-OP 1

The O 0
crust B-T 2

bite O 0

a O 0
good B-OP 1
chew O 0

the O 0
sauce B-T 2

a O 0
nice O 0
acidity O 0
to O 0
it O 0
, O 0
the O 0
salt O 0
from O 0
the O 0
cheese B-T 2

really O 0
heightens O 0

I O 0
never O 0
used O 0
to O 0
be O 0
a O 0
fan O 0
of O 0

but O 0
am O 0
lately O 0
experimenting O 0

a O 0

more O 0
and O 0
am O 0
acquiring O 0
a O 0

Our O 0
first O 0
course O 0
was O 0
Tuna O 0
Sashimi O 0
with O 0
Green O 0

as O 0
my O 0
entree O 0
, O 0
which O 0

absolutely O 0
devoured B-OP 1
while O 0
someone O 0
commented O 0
that O 0
the O 0
Grilled B-T 2
Salmon I-T 2
dish I-T 2
was O 0
better O 0
. O 0

The O 0
entrees O 0
were O 0
served O 0
with O 0
miso O 0
soup O 0
and O 0
rice O 0
. O 0

The O 0

very O 0
well B-OP 1

easing O 0
me O 0
into O 0
the O 0

and I-T 2
blueberry I-T 2

, O 0
which O 0
was O 0
phenomenal O 0

Maybe O 0
it O 0
was O 0
the O 0
great O 0
company O 0
( O 0
I O 0
had O 0
friends O 0
visiting O 0

the O 0
super O 0

, O 0
yes O 0
, O 0
but O 0
the O 0
reason O 0
to O 0

a O 0
bit O 0
of O 0
everything O 0
on O 0
the O 0

This O 0

any O 0

This O 0

not B-OP 1
inviting I-OP 1

the O 0
food B-T 2
is O 0
totally O 0
weird O 0
. O 0

The O 0
concept O 0
of O 0
japanese B-T 2

Good B-OP 1
Food B-T 2

I O 0
went O 0
here O 0
with O 0
my O 0
boyfriend O 0

anniversary O 0
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
great B-OP 1
and O 0
tasty B-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
the O 0
sitting B-T 2
space I-T 2
was O 0
too O 0
small O 0
, O 0
I O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
like O 0
being O 0
cramp O 0
in O 0
a O 0
corner O 0
. O 0

Over O 0
all O 0
it O 0
was O 0
a O 0
very O 0
nice B-OP 1
romantic I-OP 1
place B-T 2
. O 0

I O 0
would O 0
recommend O 0

when O 0
you O 0
make O 0

I O 0
tried O 0
Pacifico B-T 2
after O 0
work O 0
a O 0
few O 0
Fridays O 0
and O 0
loved B-OP 1
it O 0
. O 0

The O 0
atmosphere B-T 2
was O 0
great B-OP 1
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
we O 0
ordered O 0
was O 0
excellent B-OP 1
, O 0
although O 0
I O 0
would O 0
n't O 0
say O 0
the O 0
margaritas B-T 2
were O 0
anything O 0
to O 0
write O 0
home O 0
about O 0
. O 0

Our O 0
waitress B-T 2
was B-OP 1
n't I-OP 1
mean I-OP 1

but O 0
not B-OP 1
especially I-OP 1
warm I-OP 1
or I-OP 1
attentive I-OP 1
either O 0
. O 0

I O 0
must O 0
say O 0
I O 0
am O 0
surprised O 0
by O 0
the O 0
bad B-OP 1
reviews O 0
of O 0
the O 0
restaurant B-T 2
earlier O 0
in O 0
the O 0

, O 0
though O 0

Maybe O 0
it O 0
has O 0
improved O 0
since O 0
then O 0
? O 0

Regardless O 0
, O 0
we O 0
'll O 0
be O 0
back O 0
and O 0
ca O 0
n't O 0
wait O 0
to O 0

take O 0
advantage O 0
of O 0
the O 0

Dumbfoundingly O 0
Poor O 0

This O 0
was O 0
, O 0
from O 0

The O 0

We O 0

Everything O 0

I O 0
took O 0
one O 0

at O 0

I O 0
was O 0

wanted O 0
to O 0
switch O 0

eat O 0
his O 0

he O 0
de-skinned O 0
the O 0

that O 0
I O 0
could O 0

did O 0
n't O 0
say O 0
anything O 0
, O 0
and O 0
guess O 0
what O 0
, O 0
the O 0
waitress B-T 2
WALKED O 0
away O 0
. O 0

So O 0
, O 0
I O 0
switch O 0
with O 0
my O 0
boyfriend O 0
again O 0
to O 0
see O 0
if O 0
maybe O 0
I O 0
could O 0
stomach O 0
the O 0
meat O 0
and O 0
spinach B-T 2
again O 0
, O 0
but O 0
the O 0
spinach B-T 2
was O 0
so O 0
undercooked B-OP 1
that O 0
I O 0
just O 0
could O 0
not O 0
bite O 0
through O 0
it O 0
. O 0

I O 0
could O 0
n't O 0
even O 0
enjoy O 0
the O 0
mashed O 0
potatoes O 0
because O 0
it O 0
was O 0
hidden O 0
completely O 0
under O 0
the O 0
chicken O 0
and O 0
spinach O 0
. O 0

I O 0
've O 0
had O 0
better O 0
chicken O 0
at O 0
BBQs O 0
! O 0
! O 0
! O 0
! O 0

So O 0
I O 0
decide O 0
to O 0
report O 0
back O 0
to O 0
the O 0
waitress O 0
because O 0
it O 0
was O 0
completely O 0
inedible O 0
. O 0

Guess O 0
what O 0
, O 0
I O 0
waited O 0
for O 0
TWENTY O 0
minutes O 0
before O 0
she O 0
came O 0
over O 0
and O 0
when O 0
she O 0
finally O 0
did O 0
, O 0
she O 0
says O 0
, O 0
`` O 0
oh O 0
well O 0
, O 0
I O 0
wish O 0
you O 0
would O 0
have O 0
said O 0
something O 0
earlier O 0
'' O 0
No O 0
apology O 0
, O 0
nothing O 0
. O 0

After O 0
that O 0
she O 0
simply O 0
took O 0
our O 0
plates O 0
, O 0
walked O 0
away O 0
, O 0
came O 0
back O 0
another O 0
TWENTY O 0
minutes O 0
later O 0
with O 0
the O 0
bill O 0
and O 0
the O 0
chicken O 0
on O 0
it O 0
! O 0

! O 0

I O 0
was O 0
literally O 0
going O 0
to O 0
explode O 0
, O 0
but O 0
instead O 0
, O 0
my O 0
boyfriend O 0
took O 0
the O 0
bill O 0
and O 0
went O 0
to O 0
find O 0
the O 0
manager O 0
. O 0

This O 0
is O 0
where O 0
it O 0
really O 0
really O 0
gets O 0
bad B-OP 1
: O 0
the O 0
manager B-T 2
said O 0
, O 0
there O 0
is O 0
absolutely O 0
nothing O 0
we O 0
can O 0
do O 0
, O 0
it O 0
's O 0
a O 0
matter O 0
of O 0
taste O 0
that O 0
she O 0
did O 0
n't O 0
like O 0
it O 0
, O 0
and O 0
I O 0
can O 0
not O 0
comp O 0
it O 0
. O 0

Again O 0
, O 0
no O 0
apology O 0
, O 0
no O 0
is O 0

anything O 0
else O 0
I O 0
can O 0
get O 0

make O 0
up O 0
for O 0
it O 0
, O 0
nothing O 0
! O 0
! O 0
! O 0
! O 0

We O 0
refused O 0
to O 0
pay O 0
for O 0
it O 0
because O 0
at O 0
this O 0
point O 0
it O 0
had O 0
nothing O 0
to O 0
do O 0
with O 0
the O 0
food O 0
anymore O 0
. O 0

The O 0
level O 0
of O 0
rudeness O 0
was O 0
preposterous O 0
. O 0

The O 0
manager B-T 2
came O 0
to O 0
the O 0
table O 0
and O 0
said O 0
we O 0
can O 0
do O 0
what O 0
we O 0

Only O 0
complaint O 0
is O 0
the O 0
pricing O 0
-- O 0
I O 0
believe O 0
it O 0
would O 0
be O 0
more O 0
reasonable O 0
to O 0
pay O 0
a O 0
dollar O 0
less O 0
on O 0
each O 0
item O 0
listed O 0

nonetheless O 0

the O 0
people O 0
who O 0
greet O 0

) O 0
has O 0
been O 0
so O 0

for O 0
the O 0
exceptional O 0
fish B-T 2

As O 0
BFC B-T 2
does O 0
n't O 0
take O 0
reservations O 0
you O 0
almost O 0
always O 0
have O 0
to O 0
wait O 0
by O 0
the O 0
bar O 0
- O 0
and O 0
be O 0
abused B-OP 1
by O 0
the O 0

until O 0
you O 0
are O 0

frizzy B-OP 1
retro O 0
girl B-T 2
( O 0
with O 0

will O 0
yell O 0
at O 0
you O 0
if O 0
you O 0
try O 0
to O 0
order O 0
a O 0
drink O 0
. O 0

I O 0
was O 0
almost O 0
amused O 0
by O 0
the O 0
fact O 0
that O 0
she O 0
was O 0
turning O 0
away O 0
customers O 0
at O 0
9pm O 0
on O 0
a O 0
Friday O 0
night O 0
because O 0
she O 0
`` O 0
had O 0
a O 0
BBQ O 0
to O 0
go O 0
to O 0
'' O 0
that O 0
night O 0
- O 0
WTF O 0
? O 0
? O 0

I O 0
'd O 0
be O 0
horrified B-OP 1
if O 0
my O 0
staff B-T 2
were O 0
turning O 0
away O 0
customers O 0
so O 0
early O 0
and O 0
so O 0
rudely O 0
! O 0

There O 0
's O 0
another O 0
girl B-T 2
who O 0
I O 0
ca O 0
n't O 0
describe O 0
, O 0
she O 0
is O 0
about O 0
5 O 0
' O 0
6 O 0
'' O 0
with O 0
brown O 0
hair O 0
, O 0
who O 0
eavesdrops O 0
on O 0
your O 0
conversation O 0
and O 0
chimes O 0
in O 0
- O 0
except O 0
she O 0
only O 0
hears O 0
the O 0
last O 0
part O 0
of O 0
what O 0
you O 0
said O 0
, O 0
so O 0
her O 0
uninvited O 0
opinions O 0
are O 0
often O 0
out O 0
of O 0
context O 0
and O 0
nothing O 0
to O 0
do O 0
with O 0
what O 0
you O 0
're O 0
* O 0
really O 0
* O 0
talking O 0
about O 0
. O 0

I O 0
'm O 0
a O 0
friendly O 0
person O 0
, O 0
so O 0
I O 0
would O 0
n't O 0
mind O 0
had O 0
she O 0
not O 0
been O 0
so O 0
nasty O 0
and O 0
gotten O 0
so O 0
personal O 0
. O 0

Again O 0
, O 0
I O 0
'd O 0
be O 0
super O 0
upset O 0
if O 0
that O 0
were O 0
my O 0
employee O 0
. O 0

Considering O 0
you O 0
will O 0
spend O 0
at O 0
least O 0
$ O 0
60 O 0
a O 0
head O 0
, O 0
I O 0
expect B-OP 1
better I-OP 1
service B-T 2
. O 0

So O 0
, O 0
if O 0
you O 0
're O 0
walking O 0
by O 0
and O 0
thinking O 0
about O 0
dining O 0
, O 0
you O 0
might O 0
want O 0
to O 0
see O 0
who O 0
's O 0
going O 0

ate O 0

weekend O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
and O 0
service B-T 2
were O 0
fine B-OP 1
, O 0
however O 0
the O 0
maitre-D B-T 2
was O 0
incredibly O 0
unwelcoming O 0
and O 0
arrogant O 0
. O 0

While O 0
finishing O 0
our O 0
meals O 0
which O 0
included O 0
a O 0
high-end B-OP 1
bottle B-T 2
of I-T 2

, O 0
our O 0

This O 0

refused O 0
to O 0

she O 0
left O 0
, O 0
followed O 0
shortly O 0
by O 0
the O 0
four O 0
of O 0
us O 0
, O 0
but O 0
not O 0
before O 0
I O 0
told O 0
him O 0

in O 0
my O 0
40 O 0
years O 0
of O 0

His O 0

condescending O 0
, O 0
totally O 0
consistent O 0
with O 0
his O 0

all O 0

A O 0
word O 0

the O 0

: O 0
you O 0

Saturday O 0

Appetizers O 0

nearly O 0
an O 0
hour O 0
. O 0

When O 0
the O 0
main O 0
course O 0
finally O 0
arrived O 0
( O 0
another O 0
45mins O 0
) O 0
half O 0
of O 0
our O 0
order O 0
was O 0
missing O 0
. O 0

Never O 0
got O 0
an O 0
explanation O 0
as O 0
to O 0
what O 0
was O 0
going O 0
on O 0
. O 0

The O 0
manager B-T 2
was O 0
rude B-OP 1
and O 0
handled O 0
the O 0
situation O 0
extremely O 0
poorly O 0
. O 0

When O 0
we O 0
threatened O 0
to O 0
leave O 0
, O 0
we O 0
were O 0
offered O 0
a O 0
meager O 0
discount O 0
even O 0
though O 0
half O 0
the O 0
order O 0
was O 0
missing O 0
. O 0

On O 0
the O 0
way O 0
out O 0
, O 0
we O 0
heard O 0
of O 0
other O 0
guests O 0
complaining O 0
about O 0
similar O 0
issues O 0
. O 0

Can O 0
 O 0
t O 0
believe O 0
how O 0
an O 0
expensive B-OP 1
NYC O 0
restaurant B-T 2
can O 0
be O 0
so O 0
disrespectful O 0
to O 0
its O 0
clients O 0
. O 0

What O 0
a O 0
hassle O 0
! O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
is O 0
very O 0
good B-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
not B-OP 1
outstanding I-OP 1
. O 0

There O 0
is O 0
no O 0
way O 0
it O 0
justifies O 0
the O 0
accolades O 0
it O 0
receives O 0
, O 0
the O 0
attitude O 0
of O 0
the O 0
staff B-T 2
or O 0
the O 0
wait B-T 2
for O 0
a O 0
table O 0
. O 0

On O 0
our O 0
last O 0
visit O 0
, O 0
they O 0
skipped O 0
over O 0
our O 0
name O 0
on O 0
the O 0
list O 0
, O 0
leaving O 0
us O 0
waiting O 0
an O 0
extra O 0
hour O 0
for O 0
a O 0
table O 0
. O 0

Mistakes O 0
happen O 0
, O 0
but O 0
they O 0
are O 0
usually O 0
accompanied O 0
by O 0
an O 0
apology O 0
, O 0
perhaps O 0
even O 0
a O 0
glass O 0
of O 0
wine O 0
. O 0
. O 0
.but O 0
not O 0
the O 0
grunt O 0
that O 0
we O 0
received O 0
from O 0
the O 0
Al O 0
Di O 0
La O 0
staff B-T 2
. O 0

Without O 0
the O 0
wait O 0
or O 0
attitude O 0
, O 0
I O 0
would O 0
probably O 0
go O 0
back O 0
, O 0
but O 0
there O 0
are O 0
just O 0
too O 0
many O 0
other O 0
restaurants O 0
in O 0
Brooklyn O 0
that O 0
are O 0
as O 0
good O 0
or O 0
better O 0
and O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
make O 0
me O 0
jump O 0
through O 0
hoops O 0
. O 0

Expensive O 0

I O 0
went O 0
there O 0
after O 0
hearing O 0
how O 0
great O 0
it O 0
was O 0
. O 0

Wow O 0
. O 0

The O 0
bread B-T 2
was O 0
stale B-OP 1
, O 0
the O 0
salad B-T 2
was O 0
overpriced O 0
and O 0
empty O 0
. O 0

The O 0
pasta B-T 2
was O 0
well B-OP 1
cooked I-OP 1
, O 0
did O 0
n't O 0
have O 0
enough O 0
sauce O 0
though O 0
or O 0
flavor O 0
. O 0

I O 0
though O 0
it O 0
was O 0
expensive O 0
and O 0
I O 0
prefer O 0
Bella O 0
Via O 0
just O 0
blocks O 0
away O 0
by O 0
far O 0
. O 0

So O 0
rude O 0
! O 0
! O 0
! O 0

I O 0
went O 0
with O 0
JWILS O 0
. O 0

Her O 0
review O 0
is O 0
above O 0
. O 0

I O 0
was O 0
one O 0
of O 0
the O 0
people O 0
that O 0
went O 0
for O 0
this O 0
horrible O 0
experience O 0
. O 0

My O 0
friend O 0
is O 0
100 O 0
% O 0
right O 0
in O 0
the O 0
experience O 0
we O 0
had O 0
. O 0

The O 0
hostess B-T 2
was O 0
rude B-OP 1
and O 0
I O 0
got O 0
a O 0
distinct O 0
feeling O 0
that O 0
they O 0
did O 0
not O 0
want O 0
to O 0
serve O 0
us O 0
. O 0

The O 0
only O 0
thing O 0
that O 0
my O 0
friend O 0
left O 0
out O 0
is O 0
that O 0
when O 0
we O 0
sat O 0
down O 0
at O 0
the O 0
bar O 0
the O 0
bartender B-T 2
disappeared B-OP 1
. O 0

I O 0
asked O 0
for O 0
a O 0
menu O 0
and O 0
the O 0
same O 0
waitress B-T 2
looked O 0
at O 0
my O 0
like O 0
I O 0
was O 0
insane O 0
. O 0

I O 0
was O 0
shocked O 0
that O 0
my O 0
friends O 0
wanted O 0
to O 0
stay O 0
after O 0
the O 0
waitress B-T 2
said O 0
, O 0
`` O 0
can O 0
I O 0
help O 0
you O 0
'' O 0
and O 0
`` O 0
how O 0
many O 0
are O 0
in O 0
your O 0
party O 0
. O 0
'' O 0

What O 0
? O 0

The O 0
three O 0
of O 0
us O 0
standing O 0
in O 0
front O 0
of O 0
her O 0
should O 0
have O 0
been O 0
an O 0
indication O 0
of O 0
how O 0
many O 0
of O 0
us O 0
there O 0
were O 0
. O 0

We O 0
did O 0
n't O 0
look O 0
like O 0
the O 0
other O 0
patrons O 0
in O 0
there O 0
so O 0
unfortunately O 0
I O 0
think O 0
that O 0
may O 0
have O 0
been O 0
part O 0
of O 0
the O 0
problem O 0
. O 0

Shame O 0
on O 0
this O 0
place O 0
for O 0
the O 0
horrible O 0
rude B-OP 1
staff B-T 2
and O 0
non-existent O 0
customer B-T 2
service I-T 2
. O 0

bad B-OP 1
staff B-T 2

generally O 0
like B-OP 1

The O 0
design O 0
of O 0
the O 0
space B-T 2
is O 0
good B-OP 1

But O 0
the O 0
service B-T 2
is O 0
HORRID B-OP 1
! O 0

I O 0
was O 0
there O 0
for O 0
brunch O 0
recently O 0
, O 0
and O 0
we O 0
were O 0
tag O 0
teamed O 0
by O 0
a O 0
waitress B-T 2
and O 0
a O 0
waiter B-T 2
. O 0

The O 0
waiter B-T 2
delivered O 0
our O 0
food O 0
while O 0
holding O 0
what O 0
appeared O 0
to O 0
be O 0
a O 0
plastic O 0
bag O 0
of O 0
garbage O 0
in O 0
one O 0
hand O 0
. O 0

I O 0
ca O 0
n't O 0
believe O 0
that O 0
it O 0
was O 0
, O 0
but O 0
please O 0
put O 0
the O 0
bag O 0
down O 0
before O 0
delivering O 0
food O 0
! O 0

The O 0
waitress B-T 2
came O 0
to O 0
check O 0
in O 0
on O 0
us O 0
every O 0
few O 0
minutes O 0
, O 0
and O 0
began O 0
to O 0
clear O 0
the O 0
plates O 0
while O 0
half O 0
of O 0
us O 0
were O 0
still O 0
eating O 0
( O 0
a O 0
big O 0
pet O 0
peeve O 0
of O 0
mine O 0
that O 0
happens O 0
almost O 0
everywhere O 0
, O 0
so O 0
I O 0
try O 0
to O 0
ignore O 0
it O 0
) O 0
. O 0

I O 0
could O 0
n't O 0
ignore O 0
the O 0
fact O 0
that O 0
she O 0
reach O 0
over O 0
the O 0
plate O 0
of O 0
one O 0
of O 0
my O 0
friends O 0
, O 0
who O 0
was O 0
in O 0
mid O 0
bite O 0
, O 0
to O 0
clear O 0
the O 0
table O 0
. O 0

She O 0
then O 0
put O 0
the O 0
check O 0
down O 0
without O 0
asking O 0
if O 0
we O 0
were O 0
done O 0
, O 0
and O 0
came O 0
to O 0
check O 0
on O 0
the O 0
bill O 0
every O 0
two O 0
minutes O 0
, O 0
even O 0
though O 0
we O 0
were O 0
one O 0
of O 0
three O 0
occupied O 0
tables O 0
. O 0

I O 0
wish O 0
I O 0
could O 0
like O 0
this O 0
place B-T 2
more O 0
, O 0
and O 0
I O 0
wish O 0
someone O 0
would O 0
retrain O 0
the O 0
staff B-T 2
